# ET0731_Free19_IOTs Project

Free19 is a car parking system that can measure the temperature of visitors at the gantry before allowing them to enter the carpark. Furthermore, it can provide real-time temperature of the recent guests, number of vacancies in the carpark, gantry gate’s on/off state through visualizations via a dashboard. If a guest's temperature is high (>37°C), the system will notify us and provide the temperature to us via email through AWS IOT & SNS.

Free19 includes a telegram bot that assists only authorized people in opening the gantry gate for guests when they are unable to access the carpark due to gate malfunction or other issues. Another function is an alert function that alarms the carpark manually, to alert guests that there is an intruder inside the carpark/somebody trying to trespass inside.

The information acquired regarding the temperature of the guests is used to keep the carpark system safe for them.
